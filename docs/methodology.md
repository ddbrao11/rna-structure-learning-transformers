## Research Motivation

RNA structure prediction remains one of the most challenging problems in computational biology due to the complex relationship between nucleotide sequence and three-dimensional structural conformation. Accurate prediction of RNA folding has significant implications for drug discovery, synthetic biology, and understanding molecular function.

Traditional approaches often rely on physics-based simulations or handcrafted heuristics, which may struggle to scale efficiently across diverse RNA sequences. Recent advances in deep learning suggest that data-driven models may learn structural representations directly from sequence data by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual relationships.

This project explores whether modern transformer-based architectures can contribute to sequence-to-structure modeling by learning implicit structural constraints from publicly available benchmark datasets. Rather than focusing solely on optimization for competition metrics, the goal is to investigate methodological strategies and research questions relevant to scalable AI-driven structural prediction.

## Research Questions

This research investigates several key questions:

Can transformer architectures effectively capture long-range dependencies necessary for predicting RNA structural configurations?

To what extent can sequence-only modeling approaches approximate structural relationships without explicit geometric priors?

What architectural or training modifications improve the representation of structural context in RNA sequences?

How do data-driven approaches compare conceptually with traditional physics-based or rule-based folding methods?

What limitations arise when applying general-purpose sequence models to highly structured biological problems?
